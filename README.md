# General Assembly SEI

* [Deployed App](https://adoring-jackson-8fd4b8.netlify.com/)


## Overview

The goal of this project was to create an application using React while accessing data from a third-party API. Using the API from OpenWeathermap.org, I created an application that tells the current weather in a particular city. To look up a city, type in which city and which country into the input field and this would generate information such as Humidity, Temperature and Conditions. 

## Technologies Used:
* React
* Open Weather API
* BootStrap
* CSS

## Version 2 Goals:
* Show  Weather over 5 Day Spread
* Add Weather images
* Add a time spread.
* Add temperature range.
